# About me 

Hi, I'm Bách, a Linguist/Cognitive Scientist from Vietnam.

I am a PhD student @[QLVL Research Group](https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/qlvl) @[KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven), working as part of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Doctoral Network [CASCADE](https://www.horizoncascade.net/). My topic is [Underlying dimensions in conceptual change](https://www.horizoncascade.net/phd4/), in which I would apply [distributional semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics#:~:text=Distributional%20semantics%20is%20a%20research,large%20samples%20of%20language%20data.) to reveal shifts in conceptual associations of different concepts through time.

I developed an interest in Linguistics in the third year of my Finance undergrad. I then obtained an MSc in Linguistics from the [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk/). I am currently expanding my understanding of the field of Cognition (Philosophy, (Cognitive) Psychology, (Cognitive/Computational) Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence). 

I am familiar with Quantitative/Statistical methods, Python and R Programming, and several Machine/Deep Learning models. Besides learning and researching about languages, I'm also experienced in teaching languages (English, Vietnamese) to different types of learners. 

My research interests are Semantics, Language Change and Variation, Construction Grammar. I am also interested in linguistic representation in (large) language models. My other interests are Martial Arts and (Classical) Singing (I am a Full Lyric Tenor).
