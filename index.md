# About me 

Hi, I'm Bách.
<!-- This doesn't need the helper for picture embedding-->

I am a PhD student @[QLVL Research Group](https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/qlvl) @[KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven), working as part of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Doctoral Network [CASCADE](https://www.horizoncascade.net/). My topic is [Underlying dimensions in conceptual change](https://www.horizoncascade.net/phd4/), in which I would apply quantitative methods to reveal and explain shifts in conceptual associations of different concepts through time.

I developed an interest in Linguistics in the third year of my Finance undergrad. I then obtained an MSc in Linguistics from the [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk/) and also became the first student in the history of the department of Linguistics to be awarded the Research Based Learning Prize for the Best Master Dissertation in Literature and Languages.

I have published (as sole author and co-author) in several (top) conferences, where my works focused on analysing and utilising linguistic data. I am also expanding my understanding of the field of Cognitive Science (Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Artificial Intelligence).

I have practical experience working as an NLP engineer in different topics such as Large Language Models, Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech. I am familiar with quantitative/statistical methods, machine/deep learning, and Python/R programming. 

Besides learning and researching about languages, I’m also experienced in translating, interpreting, and teaching languages (English, Vietnamese) to different types of learners.

My research interests are:
- Semantics
- Language Variation and Change
- xAI
- Large Language Models
- Data Science

My other, non-academic interests are Martial Arts and (Classical) Singing (I am a Full Lyric Tenor).
