# Bach Phan-Tat's CV

This general CV contains (almost) everything about me, which means it is not tailored for any specific role. If you think I could be a good fit for any role, send me a message and I will send you a more tailored, up-to-date CV.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding: 20px;">
    <div style="max-width: 800px; width: 100%;">
        <iframe 
            src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19woS9htcB_9ryTD797sgu1C2fp-w51Wo/preview" 
            width="100%" 
            height="800" 
            style="border: none; box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);" 
            allow="autoplay">

Failures are often unseen, while successes are noticeable. Because of this, many mistakenly think that everything works out well for me and consequently they tend to blame themselves for their own failures instead of considering that the world is unpredictable. 

This CV of Failures is an attempt to balance the record and provide a different perspective. The idea is not originally mine as other academics have also shared their CVs of failures before (Google 'CV of failures' and you might find plenty).

Please note that this CV might not include everything as it is written from what I can remember so far. So, if it's shorter than yours, it's probably because you have a better memory or are better at trying new things than I am.
